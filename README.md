# High-level Gesture Detection Project

## Description
As of ... <br>
April 9, 2022: A program that is capable of detecting hand gestures, and performing tasks based on specific gestures

## Requirements
* Library for hand gesture detection -> OpenCV, MediaPipe <br>
* Library for real-time gesture categorization -> PyTorch <br> 
* Datasets to train PyTorch Neural Networks -> Kaggle, Science Direct, Mendeley Data <br>

## Tasks
